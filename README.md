## Concept and Approach

Imbible is an app that lets users submit whatever they have on hand to discover what classic cocktails they are able to craft with their limited resources. In addition, a user can add whatever concoction they came up with to our list of libations and have others review it.

We wanted to reintroduce our users to the storied world of mixology. In doing so, we hope that they gain a renewed appreciation of the art to making a good drink. Just as one eats not only to be nourished, but to enjoy the flavors created through the love of food, one should drink not to be intoxicated, but to experience a similar enjoyment. We made our app with hope that we could contribute to that enjoyment.
